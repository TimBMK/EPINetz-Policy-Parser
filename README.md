# EPINetz-Policy-Parser

This is a work-in-progress update repo of the [EPINetz Policy Parser](https://github.com/EPINetz/EPINetz-Policy-Parser) featuring new features such as news data classification. The old repository is kept as-is to maintain and document the data currently available on the [EPINetz Platform](https://app.epinetz.de/). More information on the functions and logic behind the Policy Classification Process can be found [here](https://github.com/EPINetz/EPINetz-Policy-Parser/blob/master/README.md).
